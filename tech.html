                    I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br>
                     knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, <br>
                      I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br>
                       master the soft skills required for being a software developer. <br><br>
                       So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing <br>
                        push in my career as a software developer.

                Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get <br>
                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really <br>
                different from the self learning I started with. The learning was <br>
                 fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were <br>
                  presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program. <br><br>
                  Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed

                    I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio <br>
                     Academy to my news feed. I read through their curriculum and <br>
                      other details about the Bootcamp and I told myself this is the <br>
                       opportunity I've been waiting for. <br><br>
